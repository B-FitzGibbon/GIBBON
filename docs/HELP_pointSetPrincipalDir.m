% What is clear from the above is that a different system is obtained. This
% is due to the symmetry properties of the ellipsoid. However all vectors
% are colinear with the true vector directions. The output direction matrix
% is ordered in size (as per the singular value decomposition). The vectors
% turned out colinear with R_true due to the fact that the ellipsoid
% directions were biased in a similar sense. However if the order is
% altered the first, second and third axes no longer allign with what was
% viewed here as the true directions. However the singular values can also
% be requested as an output allowing the user to reorder the output
% direction matrix if desired.
